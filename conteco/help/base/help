# controlplane.base
#
# A controlplane gives access to an API that consists of 7 sections: console, repo, config, build, release, deploy and run.
# Not all controlplanes require the full API for their operations.
#
# The base implementation is not used as a standalone controlplane.
# It implements base functionality that is used by the derived controplanes.
# It provides full implementation for repo, build and release and partial implementation of config and console.
# There is no implementation for deploy and run.
